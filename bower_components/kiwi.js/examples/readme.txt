Kiwi Examples.
----------

This folder contains working JavaScript (also with Typescript equivalent code) examples of various aspects of the Kiwi.js game engine.

To view these examples you can go about it two ways. 

Option 1.
---- 
	1) Install a Web server that can run PHP.
		- We can recommend wamp: http://www.wampserver.com/en/
	
	2) Either copy/paste this folder into the webroot of your server OR set-up an alias on your server that maps to this examples folder.
		- Second option preferable as when you update Kiwi your examples will auto update as well with you having to re copy/paste each time. 

	3) Now you should be able to view the examples in your browser, through your server of course :)

OR 


Option 2.
----
	1) Create an HTML 5 webpage inside this example folder.
		- You only need the bare minimum.

	2) Create a single 'div' element with the ID of 'game' inside the body.

	3) Link in the 'kiwi.js' javascript file and then after that the javascript file of the example you want to view.
		- For example if you wanted to view the 'AddingCallbacks' example you would link in the 'AddingCallbacks.js' file after 'kiwi.js'.   

	4) Now you should be able to view that example in your browser :)
		- The downside is if you want to view other examples you will need to change the link each time.
		- Also some examples won't be 'viewable'/ won't run due to a 'cross origin' error. Go to http://www.kiwijs.org/help/frequently-asked-questions/ for more info.
